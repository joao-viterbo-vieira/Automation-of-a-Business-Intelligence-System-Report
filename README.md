# Automation of a Business Intelligence (BI) System

This repository contains my project for Industrial Engineering and Management (PEGI) titled “Automation of a Business Intelligence (BI) System.” It includes the report, presentation, and scripts developed in Google Apps Script (JavaScript) to automate data flows, reporting, and dashboards for digital marketing performance.

> **Note:** This project achieved **19/20**.

## Overview
- **Data Flow Automation**: Streamlines the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process by pulling data from multiple sources and preparing it for analysis.
- **Report Generation**: Creates and updates Google Sheets reports automatically, eliminating the need for manual data handling.
- **Dashboard Integration**: Delivers timely insights through Power BI dashboards, offering performance metrics and KPIs for strategic decision-making.

## Project Highlights
- **Time Savings**: Estimated daily savings of 1.5 hours for ETL processes and 1 hour per generated report.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Reduces manual intervention, ensuring more accurate and up-to-date reporting.
- **Scalable Structure**: The automation framework supports future extensions and additional data sources.

## Abstract

This report describes a project carried out at Clever Advertising, a company specialized in digital marketing, focusing on the automation of a Business Intelligence (BI) system.

The aim of this project was to analyze and solve issues related to the implementation of data flow automation, as well as the creation of reports and dashboards, equipped with performance indicators and metrics for monitoring and evaluating digital marketing results.

The problem-solving approach began with an observation of the company, its work environment, internal relationships, and processes.

Due to the exponential growth of information and various types of data collection from the web and social networks, the processes initially implemented in the company became inefficient.

After identifying the problem and potential areas for improvement, a literature review was conducted to study applicable solutions and technologies, highlighting the growing trend of business automation.

The creation of an efficient Business Intelligence system through data flow automation using Google App Scripts (JavaScript) improved operational efficiency. Additionally, data organization and structuring were carried out, resulting in the production of essential performance indicators and metrics for business monitoring.

Automated report generation was achieved through Google Sheets and dashboards in PowerBI, eliminating the need for manual analysis and providing timely and updated reports, as well as automating the data flow, resulting in significant time savings.

The work carried out led to estimated daily time savings of 1 hour and 30 minutes for personnel involved in the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process and 1 hour per generated report.

This project at Clever Advertising provided a valuable opportunity to investigate and apply theoretical and practical knowledge in a work environment, contributing significantly to the improvement and operationalization of data flow, management, and analysis.

The project had a positive impact on Clever Advertising, enabling the creation of a Business Intelligence system and other structures for future applications.

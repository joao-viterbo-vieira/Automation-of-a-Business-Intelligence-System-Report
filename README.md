# Automation of a Business Intelligence (BI) System

This repository contains my project for Industrial Engineering and Management (PEGI) titled “Automation of a Business Intelligence (BI) System.” It includes the report, presentation, and scripts developed in Google Apps Script (JavaScript) to automate data flows, reporting, and dashboards for digital marketing performance.

## Overview
- **Data Flow Automation**: Streamlines the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process by pulling data from multiple sources and preparing it for analysis.
- **Report Generation**: Creates and updates Google Sheets reports automatically, eliminating the need for manual data handling.
- **Dashboard Integration**: Delivers timely insights through Power BI dashboards, offering performance metrics and KPIs for strategic decision-making.

## Project Highlights
- **Time Savings**: Estimated daily savings of 1.5 hours for ETL processes and 1 hour per generated report.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Reduces manual intervention, ensuring more accurate and up-to-date reporting.
- **Scalable Structure**: The automation framework supports future extensions and additional data sources.
